## About

Probation is a portable free and open-source application for windows(linux in dev) that allows you to block <ins>your own</ins> access to certain applications and websites. Just run the program and set the time duration of the block. Once running, you'll be unable to access the urls and open blacklisted applications.

## Usage
Edit the **blocklist** file to include website urls you want to block
Add program-process names to the **forbbidenapps** file for applications that you want to block. Only do this if you know what you are doing

Examples included in /examples
***Note** The application in its current stage will be detected as malware due to the lack of a license. Feel free to compile it if it does

A GUI (im too lazy if you can help pls dm)

## Disclaimer
Only run the program if you know what you are doing. You running this script/function means you will not blame the author(s) if this breaks your stuff. Be careful on what you put in the blocklist and fobbidenapps. Incorrect usage may result in the computer crashing.
